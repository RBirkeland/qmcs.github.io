    <p>Our aim is to build a community where knowledge is shared and ideas are
implemented. To achieve it we organize the following:</p>
<div class="section" id="blog">
<h2>Blog</h2>
<!-- It's ugly, but i don't really know how to refer to arhives.html -->
<p>Share opinionated articles on technical topics on <a class="reference external" href="/archives.html">our blog</a>.
If you know something special write an article about it. Check the blog
regularly, as there are articles written by your peers who had to solve the same
problems as you do. And remember, the best way to learn something is to explain
it so somebody else.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="taster-sessions">
<h2>Taster Sessions</h2>
<p>Give an introduction to new technologies that are not yet adopted by the
industry. For example, <a class="reference external" href="http://hacklang.org/">Hacklang</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=d9134d0a355cfa447adc80db4505d5931084278a">PostgreSQL 9.4
hstore</a> and anything else you can find promising.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workshops">
<h2>Workshops</h2>
<p>Organize workshops on topics related to computing, such as <a class="reference external" href="http://apawlik.github.io/2014-02-03-TGAC/lessons/tgac/version-control/tutorial.html">Introduction to
version control</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hackathons">
<h2>Hackathons</h2>
<p>Being equipped with leading edge knowledge we test it by organizing programming
sessions over a weekend to implement a cool idea. Frankly, we just look for beer
and pizza.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="competitions">
<h2>Competitions</h2>
<p>Prepare ourselves for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/news/view/eecs-programming-competition-2014-winners-announced">programming competitions</a> by studying data structures and
algorithms. Organize such competition to figure out the smartest programmer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-acceleration">
<h2>Project Acceleration</h2>
<p>Give any kind of help so you could implement <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/qmcs/qmcs.github.io/issues?labels=project&amp;page=1">your idea</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="career-guidance">
<h2>Career Guidance</h2>
<p>Link students with companies. Even a super star developer needs to find a place
to work after the graduation!</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://software.ac.uk/cw14">Collaborations Workshop 2014 (CW14)</a> took place
in Oxford in the end of March. I was lucky to attend the last day of the meeting
dedicated to ad-hock hacking. I would characterize the main topic of the
workshop as introduction of qualitative software development in scientific
environment.  Here are my thoughts, why <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/dimazest/status/449484586717048832">reproducibility is a dream that easily
becomes a nightmare</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'll start by comparing scientists to professional programmers and operations
and argue that for an experiment to be reproducible the software has to be
reusable. Then, I'll give some suggestions on how to make a reproducible setup.</p>
<div class="section" id="scientists-are-developers">
<h2>Scientists are developers</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://pydata.org/ldn2014/speakers/#168">Mark Basham</a> at <a class="reference external" href="http://pydata.org/ldn2014">PyData London</a> stated, what I consider, the pain of researchers
in one sentence. Here is my free recall:</p>
<blockquote>
Nowadays, scientists have to process so much data that they <strong>have to</strong>
become programmers.</blockquote>
<p>I completely agree with it. It's not possible anymore to successfully run an
experiment without using highly optimized libraries for computation, IO and
result representation.</p>
<p>I would go even further and explain the growing popularity of Python and other
high level languages by the fact that they hide complex implementation behind
simple interfaces (see <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn's</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/6b38d3b3051b4be298d4df4978dc35b56d5eb3a6/sklearn/cross_validation.py">cross validation code</a> for an
example).</p>
<p>Therefore, readability and understandability of code plays an important role. To
the extent that it's very tempting to use the development version of a library
when the code is being written. For example, the user interface of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/0485089180ff70feac77bd01bf23a410a787d8e5/docs/source/whatsnew/development.rst">IPython
2</a>, which is still under development at the moment of writing, improved a lot
in comparison to the current stable version. Quite often development versions
fix encountered bugs, which might be to small to deserve a dedicated release.</p>
<p>In this mode a scientist behaves like a developer. The more recent is the
software the better.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scientists-are-not-operations">
<h2>Scientists are not operations</h2>
<p>In a software company, eagerness of developers is usually compensated by wisdom
of operations, the people responsible for running and supporting software.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>operations:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">/ɒpəˈreɪʃ(ə)ns/</p>
<p><cite>noun</cite></p>
<ol class="last arabic simple">
<li>people who are responsible for deploying and monitoring
services in a company.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In academia, usually, there is much less interest to code. Not everyone is
interested to study how an experiment is implemented. The main deliverable from
a scientist-developer is a result that hopefully beats the current state of the
art. In addition, scientists-developers have a strong opinion on what tools to
use and prefer to reinvent a wheel, rather than reuse code written by other
scientists.</p>
<p>The problem is that it's not easy to reuse code. It has to at least be
documented and well written. Both of the points require a lot of effort, which
might not be appreciated.</p>
<!-- Now it's a bit messy -->
</div>
<div class="section" id="scientists-should-be-operations">
<h2>Scientists should be operations</h2>
<p>Why should scientist care about the quality of their code? The main reason is
that eventually good code will be reused by someone else. Someone else could be
yet another person in a group, or in a group in another research center. Also,
having a widely adopted tool minimizes amount of surprises. For example, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nltk/nltk/blob/develop/nltk/corpus/reader/bnc.py">NLTK's
BNC reader</a>, which takes care of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nltk/nltk/issues/70">some corner cases</a>. (A note for a careful
reader: the amount of <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/dimazest/status/442723017958129664">regexp based code written to process XML</a> is at least
10 times larger than you think.)</p>
<p>The bad news is that even <a class="reference external" href="http://maurits.vanrees.org/weblog/archive/2013/05/holger-krekel-re-inventing-python-packaging-testing">developers are still working on easy code reuse</a>, aka
packaging, to make operations' live easier!</p>
<p>Since scientists are already developers, they should learn from operations. This
means that the environment the code runs should be similar from the moment it's
being developed to the moment it's being deployed. This prevents bugs and
minimizes works-for-me situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-good-project">
<h2>A good project</h2>
<p>The documentation of a good project should include testing and deployment
instructions.</p>
<p>The process should be automated as much as possible. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.testrun.org/tox/">Tox</a> is a tool that provides a unified interface to
run tests and hides differences across different test runners.</p>
<p>In the Python world, usage of eggs and listing of the requirements in
<tt class="docutils literal">setup.py</tt> and their versions in <tt class="docutils literal">requirements.txt</tt> makes deployment
easier, but solves only half of the problem: it takes care only of Python
dependencies and ignores system dependencies, such as libraries written in C.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> is a great tool for virtual machine
management. It allows to use a completely isolated environment as if it was
local. For example, on my Mac I can start a vagrant box with CentOS 6.5 and have
the same environment as the computing server I'll use.</p>
<p>Taking this into account, this should be necessary steps to run/develop
scientific software:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># Get the Vagrant config</span>
git/hg clone http://project-site.org/project
<span class="nb">cd </span>project

<span class="c"># Start the virtual environment</span>
vagrant up

<span class="c"># Connect to it</span>
vagrant ssh

<span class="c"># All system dependencies are installed</span>
cat README
Dialogue act tagging

The environment to run experiments described in Joe Doe. 2015. The Ultimate Dialogue act tagging.

Refer to http://project-site.org/ <span class="k">for </span>more information.

The experiment data is stored data/. To <span class="nb">test </span>the setup run:

    tox

To run the experiment <span class="nb">type</span>:

    bin/tagger doe2015

<span class="c"># Now I know what to do and happily run the experiment</span>
bin/tagger doe2015
Tagging accuracy is 100%.
</pre></div>
<p>All this fancy and clear setup requires loads of love and care. A virtual
machine image has to be built and hosted somewhere. It has to be updated from
time to time. This is why reproducibility can easily become a nightmare.</p>
<p>On other hand, having a virtual machine image it can be deployed in a cloud on a
powerful machine in the matter of minutes.</p>
